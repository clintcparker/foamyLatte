#+TITLE: *White-Metzner_Carreau-Yasuda viscoelastic constitutive model README file for version 1.6-ext* 
#+AUTHOR: Jovani                
#+DATE:  05 October 2010



* This is a simulation case for a viscoelastic fluid described by the 
  White-Metzner with Carreau-Yasuda viscosity constitutive model (White-Metzner_Carreau-Yasuda).
  The geometry was the 4:1 plane contraction. 


*** This is only an illustrative case for the White-Metzner with Carreau-Yasuda constitutive model. 
    Therefore, there are not more details published until now for this model using this geometry
    and viscoelasticFluidFoam solver.
